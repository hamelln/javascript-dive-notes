   This article is a overview of what happens from the moment Chrome's V8 JS engine downloads a script.
   Compilation is the process of translating a high-level language into a low-level language and doing things like grammar, type checking, and optimization.
   And since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, it does JIT compilation for optimizations at runtime.

Statically typed languages: specify types before execution, like Java and TypeScript.
Dynamic type language: specify types during execution, like JavaScript.
